The ONLY files you should edit in this directory are:
- server.properties
- bukkit.yml
- spigot.yml

All other files are deleted / not used.

Please ensure you do not change core functionality in these folders. All these files are diff checked, so changes *will* be picked up.

If core functionality is continously disabled, we may no longer accept submissions from you.

Thanks,
